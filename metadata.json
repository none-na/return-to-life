    "description": "PLEASE READ THE ENCLOSED README.txt FILE BEFORE PLAYING!\n\n\nA large-scale mod whose main goal is to port content from Risk of Rain 2 back to the original game. Some new content has been added as well with the goal of expanding ideas introduced by Risk of Rain 2 with content originating from Risk of Rain 1.\n\nSome aspects may be different than you remember - such changes were needed to translate the content to 2D!\n\nThis mod, by nature of porting content from a game yet to be released, is work-in-progress. As a result, some features may be missing, incomplete, or experimental - though they are most likely in development and are on the way.\n\nThis mod contains several other mods as well. Having separate installations of the following mods enabled alongside this one may cause problems:\n\n- Lunar Items\n\n- Custom Map Objects\n\n- MUL-T\n\nProfile Flags:\n\nror2_disable_reskin: Returns the game back to its vanilla look.\n\nror2_reskin_enemies: Changes the look of some enemies to their updated designs in Risk of Rain 2.\n\ndisable_elite_updates: Disables changes made to Blazing, Frenzied, Leeching, Overloading, and Volatile elites.\n\ndisable_enemy_changes: Disables changes made to vanilla RoR1 enemies, such as Golem lasers.\n\nmute_gesture: Disables the Use Item sound effect if the player has too many Gesture of the Drowned.\n\nshow_hellfire_aoe: Provides a visual indication of the Helfire Tincture's area of effect alongside its graphical effects.\n\ndisable_lunar_pods: Prevents Lunar Pods from spawning naturally.\n\ndisable_shrine_of_order: Prevents the Shrine of Order from spawning naturally.\n\n",
